# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In an attempt to incorporate third party apis such as bootstrap, JQuery, and moment.js I built an application that takes in the
current time, dynamically changes page css, and allows the user to save inputs. 

## Installation

Live site at [https://skelly1389.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/](https://skelly1389.github.io/Work-Day-Scheduler/)

## Usage

-Page will display time slots relative to current time as:
    -Green: time is later in the day
    -Red: current time
    -Gray: time has already passed
-Clicking colored section of time slot allows user to enter events as text inputs
-Clicking the blue save button saves text input to local storage
-On loading page saved inputs will automatically populate correct time slots
